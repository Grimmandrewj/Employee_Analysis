## Goal
- I was tasked with completing a research project for a fictional company called Pewlett Hackard about employees of the company during the 1980s and 1990s.
- To complete this task, I was provided six CSV files that contained employee, department, and salary information for the company
- I was to design tables for the data from the files, import the files into an SQL database, and then run queries to answer questions about the data. 
- This task included data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Method
- Initially, I reviewed the data contained in the CSV files to determine the relationships between the files.  From these files, I then constructed an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to demonstrate the relationship between the tables. 
- From this ERD, I then created table schema for each data file, making sure to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

- I then imported the data files into the created tables to populate it with the relevant data
- I then created queries to answer questions about the data regarding the employees, departments, and salaries

## Summary and Results
- The ERD reflects the relationships between the data files, showing which columns are unique and which are shared.

- The queries were successfully able to answer the questions regarding the data from the imaginary company.
- To complete the task, I successfully implemented data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
- The schema and queries were completed through use of pgAdmin PostgreSQL.
